Open-source free course on "Web Applications Development with .NET Framework and ASP.NET".

The „Web Applications Development with .NET Framework and ASP.NET” course objective is to introduce the students to the fundamentals of C#, .NET Framework, databases and Web application development with ASP.NET and AJAX. Students will learn how to build dynamic data-driven Web applications with SQL Server and ASP.NET. The course starts with the basics of C# language (data types, expressions, statements, loops, arrays, methods, strings, collections, exceptions, etc.), object-oriented programming with C# (classes and interfaces, constructors, properties, events, methods, etc.), relational databases, SQL language and SQL Server, data access technologies (LINQ and LINQ-to-SQL). The main focus is on Web technologies, starting from HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, through the fundamentals of ASP.NET and ASP.NET Web Forms. Advanced topics include building rich-data applications with ASP.NET data-bound controls, using master pages, AJAX and Silverlight. All topics covered in the course will be demonstrated in a practical session demonstrating how to build building a sample dynamic rich-data Web application from scratch, step-by-step.
